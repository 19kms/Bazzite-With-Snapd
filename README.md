⚠️ WARNING: Automatic or unexpected reboots may occur

We are actively investigating and working toward a permanent solution. Please save your work frequently and be aware that system reboots may happen without notice during updates or image switches.

If you want to turn off auto-updating until this is resolved, run:

	sudo systemctl disable --now bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer

**Note:** With auto-updating disabled, you will need to update manually:

	sudo bootc upgrade
	sudo reboot
